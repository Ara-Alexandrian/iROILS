    "This notebook contains functions for connecting to a Redis server, storing data to Redis, fetching specific events from Redis, converting events to a pandas DataFrame, and clearing the Redis cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions included are:\n",
    "\n",
    "connect_to_redis: Connects to a Redis server using the provided host, port, and password.\n",
    "store_data_to_redis: Stores data from a pandas DataFrame to Redis.\n",
    "fetch_near_miss_events: Fetches all near-miss events from Redis, with an optional location filter.\n",
    "events_to_dataframe: Converts a list of events to a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "clear_redis_cache: Clears all keys in all databases of the Redis server.\n",
    "To use these functions, you need to provide the Redis server details, such as host, port, and password. You also need to provide the path to an Excel file containing the data you want to store in Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that you need to have the pandas and redis libraries installed in order to run these functions.\n",
