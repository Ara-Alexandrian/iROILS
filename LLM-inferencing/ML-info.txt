1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a Python virtual environment for your project to manage dependencies.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean your narratives if not already done.
   - Tokenize text and remove stop words.
   - Optional: Lemmatization.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze term frequency.
   - Identify potential keywords and entities manually.

4. **Model Selection and Implementation**
   - **NER and Keyword Extraction**
     - Use spaCy for Named Entity Recognition.
     - Experiment with TF-IDF for keyword extraction.
   - **Topic Modeling**
     - Use Gensim for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

5. **Model Training and Fine-tuning**
   - Train models on your dataset.
   - Fine-tune parameters for optimal performance.

6. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
   - Iterate to improve model performance.

7. **Integration**
   - Automate tagging in your system.
   - Implement filtering based on tags.

8. **Optimization**
   - Optimize code for GPU acceleration.
   - Implement parallel processing for efficiency.
