      "A patient with two isocenters on the left side of their body (one in the left humerus and one in the left ribs) required a radiation therapy treatment plan. The gantry was planned to rotate for the posterior-anterior (PA) field towards the patient's right side (359 degrees). However, it would have been more efficient if the PA field with the gantry had been at 1 or 0 degrees instead. There was also a risk of collision due to the need to move the table laterally to rotate the gantry under the table and then place it back to the isocenter.\n",

The summary accurately captures the main points of the narrative, including the two isocenters on the left side of the body, the planned rotation of the gantry for the PA field towards the patient's right side, and the collision risk due to the need to move the table laterally. However, the summary does not explicitly mention that it would have been more efficient if the PA field with the gantry had been at 1 or 0 degrees instead.
