For example, the narrative states that \"the therapists set patient up with the current proton immobilization\" while the summary says \"therapists prepared the patient using the current proton immobilization devices\". Additionally, the narrative states that \"we discovered the patient was re-simulated with another setup and immobilization devices\" while the summary says \"the patient had been resimulated with different setup and immobilization devices\". These differences in phrasing do not significantly alter the meaning of the text, but they are worth noting. Overall, the summary accurately conveys the main points of the narrative and can be considered 'Similar'.\"\n",

For this second fraction (out of three prescribed fractions), the cylinder was inserted prior to treatment appropriately and the placement was confirmed by the attending and resident physicians. The treatment was performed following regular procedures. After the treatment delivery (approximately 8 minutes) the team prepared to remove the vaginal cylinder and it was noted that the device that holds the cylinder in place was loose. On further review, the cylinder had come out of the vagina with a distance of 6 cm noted from the labia to the end of the 4th segment, which represents an approximate 5 cm shift. The cylinder position relative to the patient was not visible from the treatment cameras, and therefore it is unknown when the cylinder moved during treatment. Physics reconstructed the worst case scenario dosimetrically and the physician was consulted regarding the results. The potential misadministration report was written and submitted to the radiation safety officer at approximately 3 pm on June 11th, 2021 and we are awaiting further instructions, including whether or not this is a misadministration or not.\n",

Unknowingly, the resident changed the simulation order and canceled the order that the therapist had printed. The therapist noticed on the day the patient came in that she had not been consented. The therapist called the resident to consent the patient. Ultimately a nurse did an electronic consent which was forwarded to the physician for signature. Patient was consented for treatment to her brain. Afterwards, the nurses tried at several attempts to start an IV which was unsuccessful. While waiting to hear back from the physician, I took the patient into the staging area to create a brain device as per the order printed. Once the ct area was open, the patient was scanned with a brain device. The simulation order was not opened on the computer as in the normal procedure while the patient was being scanned. The next morning the resident called after noticing the patient had a simulation to the incorrect body site.

No one ever informed therapy about change to Ethos and the schedule on Ethos was incredibly busy.  Therapy had to ask an attending to arrive at 6 am instead of 6:45 am to make room for the added Lattice pt on machine.  Therapists had to arrive at 5 am to make sure patient's chart was checked prior to starting the day. Also the plan was roughly 45 min- 1 hour long and therapy did not know so did not schedule the pt in appropriate time frame, unfortunately this caused therapists to be late on all following patients.\n",

The physicist mentioned a Lattice transmission to initiate the treatment, however, the only known Lattice therapy was scheduled for a different patient on that date. Upon consulting the dosimetrist, it was discovered that the intended patient for the Ethos Lattice therapy had been mistakenly assigned to STx. Therapists had marked on their whiteboard on March 31st that this patient was currently an IX patient and scheduled for STx with a Lattice transmission on April 7th, as per instructions from Marcrom. The dosimetrist questioned whether the patient could be non-adaptive on Ethos due to cold plans on STx. It was also learned on April 6th that all Lattice patients would be treated on Ethos. No one had informed therapy about this change, and the Ethos schedule was already very busy. Therapists had to request an attending to arrive earlier than usual at 6 am to accommodate the additional Lattice patient on the machine. They also had to arrive at 5 am to ensure the patient's chart was checked before starting the day. Additionally, the therapy session for this patient was estimated to last approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, but therapists were unaware of this and therefore did not schedule the patient in an appropriate time frame, resulting in delays for all subsequent patients.\n",

In some arc angles, the separation between the couch and patient was 10-15cm. During treatment, this separation was not there and the plan was inspected by physics to determine if a re-plan was required. The conclusion was that the patient did not require a re-sim since the dose calculation initiates photon transport modeling at the external contour. The target was quite large and it was estimated that correcting tilt in the patient due to the change in patients position would only result in a few percent change. This may be a bigger issue in the future as we are likely to incorporate couch models in our treatment planning system. In that scenario, the dose calculation would initiate at the couch top and a large separation difference, as in the case of a missing bedpan, would necessitate a re-plan.\n",

An email was sent to the doctor for confirmation of this error, and the doctor confirmed that it was indeed incorrect. The volumes were then corrected by including the previously treated area with a 5mm margin around the 5040cGy volume in the new proton therapy plans, and the plans were resubmitted for replanning with additional constraints for brainstem point dose max values.\n",

I planned them separately on the RECT dataset. The plans were sent out for review, he said we would give too much dose to heart with the conformal plans. He ask that I plan mini tangents. In my mind I wanted to keep the same isocenter as the prev tangents, so I copied the first plan and pasted it. I did not move it to the RECT dataset. I sent the plan out for review, along with the one conformal plan for PTVsb_Breast_R that was to get 1 extra fx for a total of 5fx. Both were approved, I prepared the 1.2 R Breast_ for the physics checks. She began treatment. On her 4th fx I was preparing the final boost 1.3R1 R Breast for the physics check. I was printing the yellow sheet for the shifts and when I chose 1.2 R Breast and the 1.3R1 R Breast, the computer flagged there were many origins could not print on one page. I immediately looked at the dataset that the plan was attached to, it was the original dataset. This is when I realized the error I had made. I called my manager to tell her of the event.

The physician requested conformal planning but was concerned about excessive dose to the heart, so the therapist planned mini tangents instead. Both plans were reviewed and approved, and treatment began. However, during the preparation for the final boost dose, the therapist realized that she had accidentally used the original dataset instead of the RECT dataset for both plans, which could result in incorrect shifts being printed. She reported this error to her manager and the physician, and they reviewed the plans together to determine the impact on the treatment.\n",

The therapist asked me if I was sure we planned on the correct scan. She then suggested we try the old mask and see what the images looked like…sure enough they lined up very nicely.

During the first weekly chart check (3rd treatment fraction), the physicist noticed that one of the reference points was mislabelled.

The physicist contacted the dosimetrist to change the reference point name. The dosimetrist revised the treatment plan and corrected the reference point name.

The physician wanted to know the current physical dose status of the spinal cord after the 3/5, 3/5 and 3/10 deliveries. A weighted plan sum was used for the current ratio of delivered fractions, the spinal cord was estimated to have 17Gy after 3 fractions. This is the main critical structure that has overlap (R lung and TSpine). Luckily the tissues in the lung seem to mostly act like a shield for the spine and there isn't significant additional primary exposure. The primary physician was okay to proceed with the lung plan based on that, since the lung plan was only 150 cGy per fraction.    The main takeaway/concern from all of this is that somewhere upstream there was a gap that enabled this patient to get concurrent Iso treated. Had there been more OAR overlap or higher doses per fraction involved, this could've been a severe incident. One thing to note is that the plan IDs were 2.1 TSpine, 2.1 LSpine, and 2.1 R Lung_Fi, and all three were treatment approved. Had they been 2.1 and 2.2 it would've likely prevented the situation or resulted in the therapists questioning the delivery schedule.\n",

The Tspine and L spine treatments were intended to be delivered concurrently, but the lung treatment was supposed to follow after the completion of the spine treatments.

      "A patient with high needs lost weight and had noticeable space in their mask. On September 8, 2021 (16th fixation), a POD authorized a CBCT scan to evaluate the weight loss and determine if a removable splint (resim) was necessary. The MD reviewed the images and agreed that a resim might be required. However, when asked about the CT results a few days later, the MD stated they would look at it later. A therapist requested an update on September 16, 2021 (21st fixation), but the MD deferred the decision. On September 20, 2021 (23rd fixation), when the MD was the DOD, a third therapist asked for their assessment of the patient's condition and acknowledged the significant weight loss, leading the MD to conclude that a resim was indeed needed.\n",

When we finally got pt in the room and setup for tx we compared the MUs to the paper work vs the tx console and they did not match. So after another 25mins of waiting it was determined that the error from dos caused the MUs not to match.

      "During the pre-treatment imaging, the gantry collided with the patient immobilization system. The patient was a left sided breast patient and the couch was offset 11 cm laterally. The imaging flow is 2 kV orthos, then CBCT. kV orthos for breast are taken with the gantry in the anterior position, and the CBCT starts from the posterior side. The system has a function when the CBCT is queued to move the couch back to center to achieve clearance on the under couch gantry position. The imaging system was not loading quickly so the therapist decided to by bypass the auto CBCT and put the gantry in the low position to take the kv Orthos to improve efficiency. The idea was that after the kV ortho imaging, the machine would be ready to take the CBCT. Instead because the machine auto functions were not used and the kV ortho set was taken at a different position than was standard used, the gantry did not clear the right side of the patient and the snout pressure guard was pressed during auto motion of the gantry.\n",
