For this second fraction (out of three prescribed fractions), the cylinder was inserted prior to treatment appropriately and the placement was confirmed by the attending and resident physicians. The treatment was performed following regular procedures. After the treatment delivery (approximately 8 minutes) the team prepared to remove the vaginal cylinder and it was noted that the device that holds the cylinder in place was loose. On further review, the cylinder had come out of the vagina with a distance of 6 cm noted from the labia to the end of the 4th segment, which represents an approximate 5 cm shift. The cylinder position relative to the patient was not visible from the treatment cameras, and therefore it is unknown when the cylinder moved during treatment. Physics reconstructed the worst case scenario dosimetrically and the physician was consulted regarding the results. The potential misadministration report was written and submitted to the radiation safety officer at approximately 3 pm on June 11th, 2021 and we are awaiting further instructions, including whether or not this is a misadministration or not.\n",

      " The event describes two separate cases of individuals, one being a 64-year-old male (M) and the other a 39-year-old female (F), both diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anus. For the first case, the prescription notes indicate that the patient is planning for concurrent chemoradiation therapy (chemoRT) using 5-FU and MMC as primary treatment, but there is no prior history of radiation therapy (RT). In the second case, a 39-year-old female is also planning for concurrent chemoradiation therapy, but this time for sequential boost plans. No other information about their medical histories or conditions is provided in the narrative.\n",

      "Explanation: The generated summary accurately reflects the meaning of the narrative. It correctly identifies two separate cases of individuals diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anus, and provides details about their treatment plans, including the use of concurrent chemoradiation therapy and the absence of prior radiation therapy for the first case. The summary also notes that no other information is provided in the narrative, which is consistent with the original text. Overall, the summary accurately conveys the key points of the narrative and matches its meaning closely, making it an identical match.\n",

However, the summary uses slightly different wording than the narrative, which is why I have rated it as 'Similar' rather than 'Identical'.\"\n",
